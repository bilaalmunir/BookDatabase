This simple  project  was created to get familiar with JAVA - SPRINGBOOT.
TO PRACTICE AND PLAY WITH THE HIBERNATE TOOL.
 CREATING , DELETING , UPDATING AND READING DATA USING IT.
 ALSO, IT WAS CREATED TO GET UNDERSTANDING OF POSTMAN AND HOW TO TEST REST API WITH IT.
 THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS NOT FRONTEND SO IT BASICALLY HAS ONLY TWO PAGES :
 (JUST TO PRACTICE A LITTLE WITH FRONTEND-BACKEND CONNECTIVITY AND HOW THE ATA TRAVELS FROM USER TO WEBSITE TO DATABASE )
 1- INDEX PAGE: THAT TAKES DATA OF A USER AND APPEND IT TO DATABASE (USING REST API )
 2- SUCCESS PAGE: THAT SIMPLY GET INVOKED ITSELF AFTER THE DATA IS SAVED IN DATABASE.
